Welcome to Alertif!

This is a Ruby on Rails web application that aims to anonymously alert car owners that something is wrong with their vehicle (i.e. accidently left headlights on). 

Alertif makes use of the Twilio API. Users provide their license plate and phone numbers when signing up and if they see a vehicle with its headlights on or someone left their kids in the car for too long, then users can enter in that vehicle's license plate number, write a message, and Alertif will match that license number to the corresponding owner's phone number and send a SMS text message.
